This is the resistance associated with the chemical reactions that occur at the electrode surfaces, specifically the transfer of electrons between the electrode and the electrolyte. These reactions might not proceed instantaneously even when there's a potential difference, leading to a kind of "resistance" to the flow of current. This resistance can be influenced by factors like the nature of the electrode material, the electrode surface area, and the reaction kinetics. For example, a platinum electrode might have lower kinetic resistance for a hydrogen oxidation reaction compared to a nickel electrode, because platinum is a better catalyst for this reaction.
