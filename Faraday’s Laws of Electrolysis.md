**Definition:**

Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis are two laws that quantitatively relate the amount of material produced (or consumed) at an electrode during an electrolysis reaction to the amount of electricity that was passed through the system.

1. [[Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis]] states that the mass of a substance produced at an electrode during electrolysis is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell. Mathematically, m = ZQ, where m is the mass of substance, Q is the quantity of electricity, and Z is the electrochemical equivalent of the substance.

2. [[Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis]] states that when the same quantity of electricity is passed through several electrolytic cells in series, the amount of substance produced is directly proportional to their equivalent weights. 

**Context:**

Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis provide the fundamental basis for electrochemistry and are essential to our understanding of many practical applications, including electroplating, electrorefining, and electrolytic production of chemicals. 

**Intuition:**

Imagine you're filling several different balloons with air. The first law says that the more air (electricity) you pump into a balloon (electrolyte), the bigger it gets (the more substance is produced). The second law says that if you use the same pump (same quantity of electricity) on several balloons, the amount of air in each balloon will be proportional to its capacity (equivalent weight).

**Example:**

Let's look at an example where we have an electrolytic cell with copper sulfate solution and two copper electrodes. We want to calculate how much copper will be deposited at the cathode if a current of 2 Amps is passed for 30 minutes.

First, we'll convert the time to seconds since the charge is usually measured in coulombs (where 1 C = 1 A * 1 s): 30 minutes * 60 s/minute = 1800 s.

Next, we'll calculate the total charge passed through the cell: Q = It = 2 A * 1800 s = 3600 C.

Now, we need to use Faraday's constant, which states that one mole of electrons has a charge of approximately 96485 C. 

To calculate the number of moles of copper that will be deposited, we'll use the fact that the copper ion Cu^2+ needs two electrons to become copper metal Cu. Hence, the moles of copper deposited will be (3600 C) / (2 * 96485 C/mol) = 0.0187 mol.

Finally, by using the molar mass of copper (63.5 g/mol), we can find the mass of copper deposited: m = n * M = 0.0187 mol * 63.5 g/mol = 1.19 g.

So, if a current of 2 Amps is passed for 30 minutes, approximately 1.19 g of copper will be deposited on the electrode. This calculation is based on Faradayâ€™s Laws of Electrolysis.
