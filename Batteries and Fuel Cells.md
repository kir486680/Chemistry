**Definition:**

A [[Battery]] is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. It consists of one or more electrochemical cells, each of which includes an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The [Anode]] and [[Cathode]] (the electrodes) host a chemical reaction that results in the flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing electric current.

A [[Fuel Cell]], on the other hand, is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Unlike a battery, which runs down and needs to be recharged, a fuel cell can operate continuously as long as it is supplied with fuel and an oxidant.

**Context:**

Batteries and fuel cells are essential components of modern technology, used in everything from cars to smartphones. They are based on the principles of electrochemistry, specifically redox reactions. The study of batteries and fuel cells also ties in with the concepts of electrode potential, Nernst equation, and Faraday's laws of electrolysis. 

**Intuition:**

Think of a battery as a reservoir of chemical energy. When a device is connected to a battery, a chemical reaction occurs that releases this stored energy and converts it into electrical energy. This is similar to water stored in a dam: when the gates are opened, the potential energy of the water is converted into kinetic energy.

Fuel cells are a bit different. They're like a continuously running engine that needs a constant supply of fuel to keep going. As long as there's fuel available, a fuel cell can keep generating electricity.

**Example:**

An example of a common battery is the alkaline battery. Its anode is made of zinc, the cathode is made of manganese dioxide, and the electrolyte is a basic paste.

An example of a fuel cell is the hydrogen fuel cell used in some electric vehicles. Hydrogen gas (the fuel) is supplied to the anode, and oxygen (from the air) is supplied to the cathode. At the anode, hydrogen is split into protons and electrons, and the electrons travel through an external circuit to the cathode, generating electricity. At the cathode, the electrons, protons, and oxygen combine to form water, which is the only waste product. This is why hydrogen fuel cells are considered a clean technology.

In a laboratory setting, you could build a simple battery using lemons or potatoes, copper and zinc electrodes, and wires to connect the electrodes. This would demonstrate the basic principles of a battery: the lemon or potato acts as the electrolyte, and the chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the electrodes generates an electric current.

For fuel cells, a demonstration might involve using a small, commercially available hydrogen fuel cell. You would supply the fuel cell with hydrogen and oxygen (or air), and then use the electricity generated by the fuel cell to power a small device, like a light bulb or a motor.
