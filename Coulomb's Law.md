Coulomb's Law, named after French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, describes the electrostatic force between two electric charges. It provides a quantitative relationship between the magnitudes of the charges, the distance between them, and the strength of the force they exert on each other.

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

F = k * (|q₁| * |q₂|) / r²

where F is the electrostatic force between the charges, k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 9 × 10^9 N m²/C²), q₁ and q₂ are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between the charges.

Implications of Coulomb's Law:
1. Like charges repel, while opposite charges attract: If the charges are of the same sign (both positive or both negative), the force between them is repulsive, causing them to push away from each other. Conversely, if the charges have opposite signs, the force between them is attractive, causing them to pull towards each other.

2. The force decreases with distance: Coulomb's Law tells us that the force between two charges decreases as the square of the distance between them increases. This inverse square relationship means that the force weakens rapidly as charges move farther apart.

Intuition behind Coulomb's Law:
Coulomb's Law can be understood intuitively through the following points:

1. The closer the charges, the stronger the force: As the distance between charges decreases, the force between them increases. This is because the electric field produced by one charge at a point closer to it is stronger, resulting in a stronger force on the other charge.

2. The magnitude of the charges matters: The force between charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes. Larger charges will experience a stronger force compared to smaller charges, given the same distance between them.

Examples of Coulomb's Law:
1. Two positive charges: Consider two positive charges, q₁ and q₂. According to Coulomb's Law, they will repel each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

2. Attraction between protons and electrons: In an atom, the nucleus contains positively charged protons, while negatively charged electrons orbit around it. The electrostatic force of attraction between the positive protons and negative electrons holds the atom together.

3. Charging by rubbing: When you rub a balloon against your hair, electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon, resulting in the balloon becoming negatively charged and your hair becoming positively charged. Coulomb's Law explains the attraction between the charges on the balloon and your hair.

Coulomb's Law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism and plays a crucial role in understanding and predicting the behavior of electric charges and their interactions.
