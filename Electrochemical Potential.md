# Electrochemical Potential Lecture Notes

## Definition and Importance of Electrochemical Potential
- Electrochemical potential is a measure of the free energy per unit of a substance. It is crucial in determining the direction of spontaneous reactions.
- It includes both the chemical potential (related to concentration or activity of species) and the electric potential (related to charge).
- The concept of electrochemical potential is central to understanding equilibria in electrochemical systems.

## Equilibrium and Electrochemical Potential
- At equilibrium, the chemical potential of a species is the same in all phases.
- The electrochemical potential accounts for both the chemical energy associated with a species and the work done against the electric field if the species carries a charge.
- The electrochemical potential of a species i is given by:

$$
\mu_i = \mu_i^0 + RT \ln a_i + z_i F \phi
$$

where:
  - \(\mu_i\) is the electrochemical potential,
  - \(\mu_i^0\) is the standard chemical potential,
  - \(R\) is the gas constant,
  - \(T\) is the temperature,
  - \(a_i\) is the activity of the species,
  - \(z_i\) is the charge of the species,
  - \(F\) is the Faraday constant, and
  - \(\phi\) is the electric potential.

## Electrochemical Equilibrium Examples
- Consider a system with sodium in contact with a gas. At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of the sodium in the metal phase equals the electrochemical potential of the sodium in the gas phase.
- In a cell with a copper wire in contact with a Cu2+ solution, the electrochemical potential of the Cu2+ ions in solution equals the electrochemical potential of the copper in the metal phase.
- The difference in electrochemical potential between two points is related to the cell potential, which can be measured with a voltmeter.

## Nernst Equation
- The Nernst equation relates the cell potential to the reaction quotient and the standard cell potential. It is given by:

$$
E = E^0 - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q
$$

where:
  - \(E\) is the cell potential,
  - \(E^0\) is the standard cell potential,
  - \(R\) is the gas constant,
  - \(T\) is the temperature,
  - \(n\) is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,
  - \(F\) is the Faraday constant, and
  - \(Q\) is the reaction quotient.

- The Nernst equation allows us to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions.

## Electrochemical Potential in Real Systems
- In real systems, the electrochemical potential can be influenced by various factors such as the presence of a membrane or a double layer, the concentration of the species, and the electric field.
- The concept of electrochemical potential is crucial in understanding phenomena such as the movement of ions across a membrane or the flow of current through a conductor.

## Electric Potential (Φ)
- The electric potential, often denoted by the Greek letter Φ (phi), is a measure of the work done per unit charge to move a positive test charge from a reference point (usually infinitely far away) to a specific point in an electric field. It is typically measured in volts (V).
- The electric potential at a point in space is the electric potential energy (U) per unit charge (q) at that point, i.e., Φ = U/q.
- The electric potential is related to the electric field (E) by the equation Φ = - ∫ E • dl, where the integral is taken along the path from the reference point to the point of interest.

## Summing Half Reactions
- In electrochemistry, a redox reaction is often divided into two half-reactions: one for oxidation (loss of electrons) and one for reduction (gain of electrons). Each half-reaction has its own standard potential (E°) and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°).
- The overall reaction is obtained by adding the half-reactions together. The standard potential for the overall reaction (E°_cell) is the difference between the standard potentials of the half-reactions, i.e., E°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode.
- The Gibbs free energy change for the overall reaction (ΔG°) is the sum of the Gibbs free energy changes for the half-reactions. However, because ΔG° = -nFE°, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred and F is the Faraday constant, we can also calculate ΔG° from the standard potential of the overall reaction.

## Standard Reduction Potential (E°)
- The standard reduction potential (E°) of a half-reaction is the potential of a half-cell under standard conditions (1 M concentrations for all ions, 1 atm pressure for all gases, and a temperature of 25°C), relative to the standard hydrogen electrode, which is arbitrarily assigned a potential of 0 V.
- It is usually written as a reduction half-reaction, i.e., the species gains electrons. For example, the standard reduction potential for the Cu2+/Cu half-reaction is +0.34 V, which means that Cu2+ ions gain electrons to form Cu metal under standard conditions.

## Reducing and Oxidizing Agents
- A compound is a reducing agent if it loses (donates) electrons, and it is an oxidizing agent if it gains (accepts) electrons.
- The more negative the standard reduction potential, the better the compound is as a reducing agent. Conversely, the more positive the standard reduction potential, the better the compound is as an oxidizing agent.
- This is because a negative E° means the compound prefers to be oxidized (lose electrons), while a positive E° means the compound prefers to be reduced (gain electrons).

## Electrochemical Potential and Electron Energy Levels
- The electrochemical potential of a species is related to the energy level of the electrons in that species. A species with a higher electrochemical potential has a higher energy level and is more likely to lose electrons (be oxidized).
- The work done to move a charged particle in an electric field is equal to the charge of the particle times the change in electric potential. This is analogous to the work done against gravity to lift an object, which is equal to the mass of the object times the change in gravitational potential.
