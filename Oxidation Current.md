The **oxidation current** is the electric current that results from the flow of electrons that are released during the oxidation reaction. For example, consider the oxidation of sodium (Na) to sodium ions (Na+):

Na -> Na+ + e-

In this reaction, each sodium atom loses one electron to become a sodium ion. The electrons that are released flow through the external circuit, creating an electric current. This is the oxidation current.
