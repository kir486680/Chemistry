An electric field is a region of space around an electric charge where it exerts a force on other charges. The electric field at a point is defined as the force per unit charge experienced by a test charge placed at that point.

Equation: E = F/q

where E is the electric field, F is the force experienced by the test charge, and q is the magnitude of the test [[Electric Charge]].

1.  Electric Field due to a Point Charge: The electric field produced by a point charge q at a distance r from the charge is given by [[Coulomb's Law]]:
    
    Equation: E = k * (q / r^2) * r̂
    
    where E is the electric field vector, k is Coulomb's constant (k ≈ 9 × 10^9 N m²/C²), q is the charge, r is the distance from the charge, and r̂ is the unit vector in the direction of r.
