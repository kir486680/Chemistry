A measure of work per charge that can be done in moving a particle from x1 to x2. 
Electrostatic potential, often denoted by the symbol φ (phi), is a scalar field that represents the electric potential energy per unit charge at a given point in an electric field. It provides a measure of the potential energy that would be possessed by a unit positive charge placed at that point.

The electrostatic potential φ is related to the [[Electric Field]] E by the equation:

E = -∇φ

where E is the [[Electric Field]] vector, and ∇φ represents the gradient of the electrostatic potential.
Alternatively, 
$\phi$=∫ -E dx. The work is negative when a charge moves in the direction of the electric field, and it is positive when a charge moves against the field.

$\frac{\Delta U}{q}$ =$\phi$  relates it to [[Potential Energy]] 


Implications of Electrostatic Potential:
1. Energy distribution: Electrostatic potential describes the distribution of electric potential energy within an electric field. It quantifies the amount of potential energy associated with a charge at different points within the field.

2. Charge behavior: The electrostatic potential influences the behavior of charges within an electric field. Charges tend to move from regions of higher potential to lower potential, similar to objects moving from higher to lower elevations due to gravitational potential.

Intuition behind Electrostatic Potential:
1. Potential energy per unit charge: Electrostatic potential is a measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge. It represents the amount of potential energy possessed by a unit positive charge placed at a specific point in the electric field.

2. Analogous to height: Electrostatic potential can be analogized to height in a gravitational field. Just as an object at a higher elevation possesses more gravitational potential energy, a charge at a point with higher electrostatic potential possesses more electric potential energy.

Examples of Electrostatic Potential:
1. Point charge: For a single point charge, the electrostatic potential follows an inverse relationship with distance. As you move farther from the charge, the electrostatic potential decreases, indicating a decrease in electric potential energy.

2. Uniform electric field: In a uniform electric field, the electrostatic potential is constant throughout. This implies that the electric field is conservative, and no work is done in moving a charge within the field.

3. Capacitors: In a capacitor, the electrostatic potential difference, also known as voltage, is established between its plates. The potential difference determines the amount of energy stored in the electric field between the plates.

4. Conductors: In a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electrostatic potential is constant throughout its interior. This is because charges within the conductor redistribute themselves to reach a state of equilibrium, where the electric potential is uniform.
