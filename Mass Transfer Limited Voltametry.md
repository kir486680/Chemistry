**Mass Transfer Limited Voltammetry** is a key concept in electrochemistry that deals with the control of current response in an electrochemical cell. This concept is particularly important when the reaction kinetics are very fast, and the rate of mass transfer of the species to the electrode surface becomes the limiting factor for the current response.

The basic assumptions are:
1. Assume there is no mass transport by migration 
2. Rapid stirring occurs so the concentration is maintained at the stagnant layer. 
3. Make assumption that the surface reaction is purely controlled by diffusion


**Key Concepts:**

1. **Mass Transfer:** In a mass transfer limited scenario, the rate of the electrochemical reaction is not determined by the inherent speed of the reaction itself, but rather by how quickly the reactant species can be delivered to the electrode surface. This is analogous to a factory production line where the assembly speed is not limited by the speed of the workers, but by how quickly the parts can be delivered to the assembly line.
    
2. **Current and Faraday's Law:** The current (i) in an electrochemical cell is given by Faraday's Law: i = nFAcD^(1/2), where n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is Faraday's constant, A is the electrode area, c is the concentration of the reactant species, and D is the diffusion coefficient of the reactant species. This equation shows that the current is directly proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient. This means that the faster the species can diffuse to the electrode surface, the higher the current will be.
    
3. **Limiting Current and the Cottrell Equation:** In a voltammetry experiment, the potential is swept, and the current response is measured. In a mass transfer limited scenario, the current will increase with increasing potential until a maximum current (i_max) is reached. This maximum current is known as the limiting current and is determined by the rate of mass transfer of the species to the electrode surface. The limiting current can be described by the Cottrell equation: i_max = nFAD^(1/2)c/(pi*t)^(1/2), where t is the time. This equation shows that the limiting current decreases with the square root of time. This is because as time goes on, the concentration of the reactant species near the electrode surface decreases, slowing down the rate of mass transfer and thus reducing the current.
    
4. **Nernstian Interface and the Nernst Equation:** In a system where the reaction kinetics are very fast, the interface (i.e., the electrode surface) is referred to as "Nernstian" because the electrochemical reaction is assumed to be at equilibrium. This means that the rate of the forward reaction (reduction of O to R) is equal to the rate of the backward reaction (oxidation of R to O). Under these conditions, the Nernst equation can be used to calculate the electrode potential.
    
5. **Cathodic and Anodic Limiting Currents:** In a system where both the oxidized species (O) and the reduced species (R) are present, we can have both cathodic and anodic reactions occurring at the electrode surface. The cathodic limiting current is the maximum current that can be achieved during the cathodic (reduction) reaction, and the anodic limiting current is the maximum current that can be achieved during the anodic (oxidation) reaction.
    
6. **Concentration Profiles:** The concentrations of O and R vary with distance from the electrode depending on the potential, with the concentration gradients being steepest at the electrode surface and flattest in the bulk of the solution.

If E << E0, this means that the electrode potential is much less than the standard electrode potential. In this case, the reaction will be driven towards the reduction of the oxidized species (O -> R). This means that the concentration of the oxidized species (Co) at the electrode surface will be very low (since any O that reaches the surface is immediately reduced to R), and the concentration of the reduced species (Cr) will be high.
