Measures the quantity of [[Electric Field]] lines passing through a given surface. It provides a way to quantify the flow of electric field through a surface and is closely related to the total [[Electric Charge]] enclosed by that surface.

[[Gausses Law]] governs the electric flux

Φ = ∫ E * dA = q / $\epsilon$

where Φ is the electric flux, E is the electric field vector, and dA is an infinitesimal area vector. The integral is taken over the entire surface.

Implications of Electric Flux:
1. Measure of electric field flow: Electric flux provides a measure of the amount of electric field passing through a given surface. It quantifies the number of electric field lines that penetrate or emerge from the surface.

2. Proportional to the charge enclosed: According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux passing through a closed surface is directly proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface. The electric flux can be used to infer the presence or absence of electric charge within a closed surface.

Intuition behind Electric Flux:
1. Field lines passing through a surface: Electric flux represents the number of electric field lines passing through a given surface. The electric field lines emerge from positive charges and terminate on negative charges. Electric flux measures the flow of these lines across the surface.

2. Orientation of the surface: The electric flux is affected by the orientation of the surface with respect to the electric field. The flux is maximized when the surface is perpendicular to the electric field lines, and it decreases as the angle between the surface and the field lines increases.

Examples of Electric Flux:
1. Electric flux through a closed surface: Consider a closed surface surrounding a positive charge. The electric flux passing through this surface would be positive since the electric field lines emerge from the charge and pass through the surface.

2. Electric flux through a surface enclosing no charge: If a closed surface encloses no electric charge, the electric flux passing through the surface would be zero. This is because the number of electric field lines entering the surface would be equal to the number of lines leaving the surface, resulting in a net flux of zero.

3. Electric flux through a surface with a non-uniform electric field: If the electric field is non-uniform, the electric flux through a surface will vary across different regions of the surface. The flux will be greater in areas where the electric field is stronger and lower in areas where the field is weaker.

Electric flux is a valuable concept for analyzing and understanding electric fields and their interactions with surfaces. It allows for the quantitative evaluation of electric field flow and provides insights into the distribution of electric charge.
