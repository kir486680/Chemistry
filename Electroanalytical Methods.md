**Definition:**

Electroanalytical methods refer to a set of techniques in analytical chemistry which study the chemical properties of analytes by measuring the potential (volts) and/or current (amperes) in an electrochemical cell containing the analyte. These methods can be divided into several categories, including [[Potentiometric Methods]] (such as pH metering), [[Coulometric Methods]], [[Amperometric Methods]] (such as polarography and voltammetry), and [[Conductometric Methods]].

**Context:**

These methods are crucial in electrochemistry because they offer a way to quantify the concentration of a substance in a solution. They are commonly used in a range of fields, including environmental monitoring, clinical analysis, food quality testing, and material science. They can provide information about reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and thermodynamics.

**Intuition:**

Imagine you have a mystery liquid, and you want to find out how much of a certain substance (let's say, salt) is in it. You could use an electroanalytical method to do this. You'd set up an electrochemical cell with the mystery liquid and apply a certain voltage. Then you'd measure the resulting current. Depending on the method you're using, you might change the voltage and observe how the current changes, or you might hold the voltage steady and watch how the current changes over time. These measurements would give you clues about how much salt is in the liquid.

**Example:**

A common example of an electroanalytical method is the use of a pH meter, a potentiometric method, to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The pH meter measures the potential difference between a pH-sensitive electrode (usually a glass electrode) and a reference electrode. The potential difference is then converted into a pH value using the Nernst equation.

Another example is cyclic voltammetry, an amperometric method, which involves cycling the potential of a working electrode in an electrochemical cell and measuring the resulting current. The shape of the resulting voltammogram (a plot of current versus potential) can provide information about the oxidation and reduction potentials of the analyte, the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction, and the concentration of the analyte. This technique is frequently used in electrodeposition to study the deposition process and the properties of the deposited material.
