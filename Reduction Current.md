**Reduction** is a chemical reaction in which a substance gains electrons. In an electrochemical cell, reduction occurs at the cathode.

The **reduction current** is the electric current that results from the flow of electrons that are consumed during the reduction reaction. For example, consider the reduction of chlorine gas (Cl2) to chloride ions (Cl-):

Cl2 + 2e- -> 2Cl-

In this reaction, each chlorine molecule gains two electrons to become two chloride ions. The electrons that are consumed are supplied by the external circuit, creating an electric current. This is the reduction current.
