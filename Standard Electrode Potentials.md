**1. Definition:**

The standard electrode potential (E°), also known as [[Standard Reduction Potential]], is the potential difference (measured in volts) at an electrode when all reactants and products are at [[Standard Conditions]] and the cell is at equilibrium. It measures the tendency of a chemical species to be reduced (i.e., to gain electrons, or [[Reduction]]). 

The more positive the standard electrode potential, the greater is the species' tendency to be reduced. It's often represented as:

E° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)

where E°(cathode) and E°(anode) are the standard reduction potentials of the cathode and anode, respectively.

**2. Context:**

Standard electrode potentials provide a quantitative way to study redox reactions. They are used to predict the direction of redox reactions, calculate the [[Electromotive Force(EMF)]]) of an electrochemical cell, and understand the electrochemical properties of elements and compounds. They are fundamental to electrochemistry, battery technology, and many industrial processes.

**3. Intuition:**

Think of standard electrode potentials as a measure of how much a chemical species "wants" electrons. The higher the standard electrode potential, the greater the "desire" for electrons, and thus the greater tendency to be reduced.

**4. Example:**

For example, the standard electrode potential for the reduction of hydrogen ions (H^+) to hydrogen gas (H2) is defined as 0.00 volts. This reaction serves as the reference point for all other standard electrode potentials.

2H^+(aq) + 2e^- → H2(g)     E° = 0.00V

On the other hand, the standard electrode potential for the reduction of copper(II) ions (Cu^2+) to copper metal (Cu) is +0.34 volts.

Cu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s)     E° = +0.34V

This positive value indicates that copper(II) ions have a higher tendency to gain electrons (i.e., be reduced) compared to hydrogen ions under standard conditions. Hence, if copper(II) ions and hydrogen ions were both present in a solution, the copper(II) ions would be preferentially reduced.
