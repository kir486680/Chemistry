**Definition:**

An electrochemical cell is a device capable of either deriving electrical energy from a chemical reaction ([[Galvanic Cell]]/[[Voltaic Cell]]) or facilitating a chemical reaction through the introduction of electrical energy ([[Electrolytic Cell]]). 

Two half-cells make up an [[Electrochemical Cell]]. Each half-cell consists of an electrode (a conductor, often a metal) and an [[Electrolyte]] (an ionic substance that conducts electricity). The two half-cells may be in the same solution, or they may be connected by a [[Salt Bridge]] or porous disk to allow ions to transfer.

**Context:**

Electrochemical cells are a key concept in electrochemistry, as they provide the physical context in which redox reactions occur. They have significant practical applications, such as batteries (which are [[Voltaic Cell]]) and electrolysis equipment (which are [[Electrolytic Cell]]). 

Understanding electrochemical cells is critical for understanding how we can harness chemical reactions to produce electricity, or how we can use electricity to drive chemical reactions.

**Intuition:**

Think of an electrochemical cell as a kind of "electron pump." It either uses a spontaneous chemical reaction to pump electrons and produce electrical energy (in the case of a galvanic cell), or it uses electrical energy to pump electrons and drive a non-spontaneous reaction (in the case of an electrolytic cell).

The key thing to remember is that an electrochemical cell involves a transfer of electrons between two substances. This transfer occurs in such a way that the electrons move from where they are in excess (the [[Anode]]) to where they are needed (the [[Cathode]]).

**Example:**

A classic example of an electrochemical cell is a simple battery. 

Consider a zinc-copper cell. In the zinc half-cell, we have a zinc electrode in a zinc sulfate solution. In the copper half-cell, we have a copper electrode in a copper sulfate solution. These two half-cells are connected by a wire and a salt bridge.

Here's what happens when we connect the circuit:

1. The zinc atoms at the anode are oxidized to Zn^2+ ions, releasing two electrons into the circuit.

2. These electrons travel through the wire to the copper electrode.

3. At the copper cathode, Cu^2+ ions in solution gain these electrons, becoming copper atoms that plate onto the copper electrode.

4. The Zn^2+ ions produced at the anode enter the solution, maintaining electrical neutrality in the zinc half-cell.

5. Similarly, as Cu^2+ ions are reduced at the cathode, the salt bridge allows negative ions to flow into the copper half-cell to maintain neutrality there.

6. The result is a flow of electrical current from the anode to the cathode, driven by the redox reaction.

This example is a galvanic cell, where a spontaneous redox reaction generates electrical energy. If we wanted to reverse the reaction (remove the zinc deposited on the copper, for example), we'd need an electrolytic cell. We'd apply an external voltage to drive the non-spontaneous reaction.

Understanding electrochemical cells in this way provides a foundation for understanding many processes in electrochemistry, including the electrodeposition process you're interested in.
