(ρ): Volume charge density, denoted by the symbol ρ (rho), represents the amount of electric charge per unit volume. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

   ρ = Q / V

   where ρ is the volume charge density, Q is the total charge, and V is the volume.

   Implication: Volume charge density provides information about how charge is distributed within a three-dimensional region. It helps in understanding the overall charge distribution and its impact on the electric field in that region.

   Intuition: Imagine a solid object with a total charge Q distributed throughout its volume V. The volume charge density ρ would indicate how much charge is present within a given volume. Higher charge density implies a higher concentration of charge within a specific region.

   Example: A uniformly charged sphere with a total charge Q. The volume charge density would be ρ = Q / V, where V is the volume of the sphere.
