This is the resistance associated with the movement of reactants to the electrode surfaces and the removal of products from the electrode surfaces. When a current is flowing, reactants are consumed at the electrodes and products are produced. If the reactants can't reach the electrode surface fast enough, or if the products aren't removed quickly enough, this can limit the rate at which the reactions proceed and hence limit the current. This is similar to a situation where a road is congested with cars - even if the cars are capable of going fast, they can't because of the traffic. An example of this could be in a fuel cell, where if the hydrogen fuel can't reach the anode quickly enough, or if the water product isn't removed from the cathode quickly enough, it can limit the current that the cell can produce.
