**1. Definition:**

A cathode is the electrode in an electrochemical cell where [[Reduction]] occurs. Reduction is a process that involves the gain of electrons. In a [[Galvanic Cell]] (voltaic) cell, the cathode is positively charged, whereas in an [[Electrolytic Cell]], the cathode is negatively charged.

The general formula representing reduction at the cathode is:

M^n+ + ne^- → M

Where:
- M is the species getting reduced
- n is the number of electrons gained in the reduction process

**2. Context:**

Along with the anode, the cathode is a fundamental component of an electrochemical cell, whether it's a battery, fuel cell, or electrolytic cell. The distinction between cathode and anode is crucial as it dictates the direction of the flow of electrons and ions in the cell. Understanding the cathode's role is key to comprehending the mechanisms underlying energy conversion in electrochemical systems.

**3. Intuition:**

If the [[Anode]] is like a train station where trains (electrons) are departing, then the cathode can be seen as the destination station where these trains arrive. The arrival of trains at the cathode station represents the gain of electrons, which is the process of reduction.

**4. Example:**

In a Daniell cell (a type of galvanic cell), the cathode is made of copper. When the cell operates, copper ions (Cu^2+) in the solution are reduced at the cathode according to the following reaction:

Cu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s)

The copper ions gain two electrons to form solid copper (Cu). These electrons are provided by the zinc anode, which is simultaneously being oxidized. The solid copper deposits on the copper cathode, gradually increasing its size over time. This is an example of a reduction reaction taking place at the cathode of a galvanic cell.
