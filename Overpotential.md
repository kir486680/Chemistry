**Definition:**

Overpotential (η) is the difference between the actual potential required to drive an electrochemical reaction and the equilibrium (theoretical) potential of that reaction. It is a form of energy loss and is required to overcome various barriers to the reaction proceeding, such as the activation energy for the reaction and mass transport limitations. f you apply a positive overpotential (making the cell potential more positive), you make it more energetically favorable for [[Reduction]] to occur at the [[Cathode]]. Conversely, if you apply a negative overpotential (making the cell potential more negative), you make it more favorable for [[Oxidation]] to occur at the [[Anode]].

**Context:**

Overpotential is a critical concept in electrochemistry and especially in electrochemical engineering, as it directly impacts the efficiency of electrochemical cells. It is significant in many industrial processes like electrolysis, fuel cell technology, and batteries. Understanding overpotential helps us optimize these systems and improve their performance.

**Intuition:**

Think of driving a car up a hill. The steeper the hill (higher overpotential), the more gas you need to pump (more energy you need to provide) to reach the top (to make the reaction happen). Despite your car being capable of climbing the hill at a certain speed in ideal conditions (the equilibrium potential), in reality, it takes more energy due to factors like air resistance and the steepness of the slope (analogous to activation energy and mass transport limitations).

**Example:**

For instance, in an electrolytic cell for water splitting, the equilibrium potential required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is 1.23 volts at 25°C (under standard conditions). This is the minimum energy required to drive the reaction. 

However, in practice, a higher potential (often around 1.48 volts or more) is required to initiate the reaction. This extra potential (1.48V - 1.23V = 0.25V) is the overpotential. It accounts for the extra energy required to overcome the activation energy of the reaction and the energy lost due to inefficient mass transport of reactants and products at the electrode surface.

By understanding and minimizing overpotential, we can enhance the efficiency of electrochemical reactions, including those used in electrodeposition.
