The goal is to explain how k_f and k_b depend on E. We are going to talk about how fast the reactions will occur. 
We will talk about what happens when we are not at equilibrium and we can not use Nernst equation.

Different metals give different rates and surface effects reaction kinetics

Overpotential gives electrical energy to overcome the energy barrier like temperature gives thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier
