**1. Definition:**

An anode is the electrode in an electrochemical cell where oxidation occurs. [[Oxidation]] is a process involving the loss of electrons. In a [[Galvanic Cell]], the anode is negatively charged, while in an [[Electrolytic Cell]], the anode is positively charged. 

The general formula representing oxidation at the anode is:

M → M^n+ + ne^-

Where:
- M is the species getting oxidized
- n is the number of electrons lost in the oxidation process

**2. Context:**

The anode is one of the two primary components of any electrochemical cell, the other being the [[Cathode]]. These two electrodes create a pathway for the flow of electrons, which is essential for the operation of the cell. Understanding the roles of the anode and cathode is fundamental to the study of [[Electrochemistry]], as it allows us to understand how and where redox reactions occur in a cell.

**3. Intuition:**

Imagine the anode as a bustling train station where trains (electrons) are constantly departing. These trains are heading towards another station, the cathode, where they'll be received. The departure of trains from the anode station represents the loss of electrons (oxidation).

**4. Example:**

In a standard [[Daniell Cell]] (a type of [[Galvanic Cell]]), the anode is made of zinc. When the cell is in operation, the zinc anode is oxidized according to the following reaction:

Zn(s) → Zn^2+(aq) + 2e^-

The zinc solid (Zn) loses two electrons to become a zinc ion (Zn^2+). These two electrons then travel through the external circuit towards the cathode, driving the electric current. Meanwhile, the Zn^2+ ions enter the aqueous solution, leaving the zinc anode gradually diminished over time. This is an example of an oxidation reaction taking place at the anode of a galvanic cell.
