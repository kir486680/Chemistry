**Definition:**

Polarization in electrochemistry refers to the deviation from the equilibrium potential of an electrode during electrolysis. It is caused by a change in the concentration of reactants or products, the resistance of the electrode, or a change in the rate of the electrochemical reaction, among other factors. 

**Context:**

Polarization is a crucial concept in electrochemistry, affecting the performance and efficiency of electrochemical devices such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrolysis systems. Understanding and controlling polarization can help to optimize these systems, ensuring that they operate efficiently and effectively.

**Intuition:**

Think about trying to drive on a road covered in snow. Ideally, your car should move smoothly (the equilibrium potential), but the snow (polarization) makes it harder to drive, slowing you down and making the journey less efficient. 

**Example:**

Let's take a fuel cell as an example. In an ideal scenario, the voltage output of the fuel cell would be equal to the theoretical cell voltage. However, in reality, the actual output voltage is usually less than the theoretical cell voltage. This decrease is due to polarization.

Polarization can be categorized into three types: activation polarization, concentration polarization, and ohmic polarization.

1. **[[Activation Polarization]]** is due to the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to occur.

2. **[[Concentration Polarization]]** occurs when there is a change in the concentration of the reactants or products at the electrode surface during operation, leading to a deviation from the equilibrium potential.

3. **[[Ohmic Polarization]]** arises from the resistance to the flow of ions in the electrolyte and electrons in the electrode material.

Each of these forms of polarization reduces the efficiency of the fuel cell, and understanding them can help in the design of more efficient electrochemical systems. 

In the context of electrodeposition, understanding polarization is important as it can affect the quality of the deposited layer. For instance, high levels of polarization can lead to non-uniform deposition or the formation of unwanted side products. By controlling the conditions of the deposition process (like the current density or the composition of the electrolyte), we can minimize polarization and improve the quality of the electrodeposition.
