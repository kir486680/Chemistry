1. **Definition:** Voltammetry is an electroanalytical method used to study electrochemical systems. The technique involves applying a potential sweep to an electrochemical cell and measuring the resulting current. The potential sweep causes the oxidation or reduction of species in the cell, and the current is proportional to the concentration of the species. The resulting current vs. potential plot (voltammogram) provides information about the [[Electrochemical Kinetics]], [[Thermodynamics]], and [[Electrochemical Reaction Mechanisms]] occurring in the cell.

2. **Context:** Voltammetry is one of many electrochemical techniques used to study and characterize electrochemical systems. Its strength lies in its ability to probe the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions, which complements other techniques like [[Potentiometry]] and [[Conductometric Methods]]. In voltammetry, you're essentially probing how different species in your system respond to changes in potential, and this gives you insights into the redox behavior and concentrations of these species.

3. **Intuition:** Imagine you're trying to understand how different species in a solution respond to changes in electrical potential. You could apply different potentials and measure how much current flows, giving you a "picture" of how the different species in the solution respond to these potentials. That's the essence of voltammetry. It's like taking a "snapshot" of the behavior of your system at different potentials, giving you insights into the electrochemical reactions occurring in the system.

4. **Example:** A common form of voltammetry is cyclic voltammetry. In this technique, the potential is swept linearly back and forth between two values. When the potential is such that it can reduce or oxidize a species in solution, a current will flow, and a peak will appear in the voltammogram. The position of the peak gives information about the potential at which the reaction occurs, and the size of the peak gives information about the concentration of the species. This can be used, for example, to study the redox behavior of a new organic compound or to determine the concentration of a pollutant in a water sample.
