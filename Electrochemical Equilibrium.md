**1. Definition:**

Electrochemical equilibrium in a redox system is a state where the rate of the oxidation reaction equals the rate of the reduction reaction, resulting in no net electron transfer and hence no observable current. It is the state of maximum entropy or minimum free energy for the system. 

At this equilibrium, the electrical potential difference between the oxidized and reduced species is known as the equilibrium potential (E). It can be calculated by the [[Nernst Equation]]:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln([Red]/[Ox])

where:
- E° is the standard electrode potential
- R is the gas constant
- T is the absolute temperature
- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
- F is Faraday's constant
- [Red] and [Ox] are the concentrations of the reduced and oxidized species, respectively

**2. Context:**

The concept of electrochemical equilibrium is crucial in understanding the behavior of batteries, fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and other electrochemical systems. It is directly linked to concepts such as 
# [[Electrode Potentials]]
At electrochemical equilibrium, the electrode potential becomes the equilibrium potential. It represents the potential difference across the electrode and electrolyte when there is no net electron transfer between them, i.e., when oxidation and reduction rates are equal. It is this balance of reactions that ensures the stability of the electrode potential at equilibrium.
# [[Overpotential]]
When a cell is at electrochemical equilibrium, the overpotential is zero because the rates of the forward (oxidation) and reverse (reduction) reactions are the same, and no extra potential is needed to favor one over the other. When we move away from equilibrium (by applying an external potential), overpotentials come into play, driving the reaction in the desired direction.
# [[Electrochemical Kinetics]]
At electrochemical equilibrium, the rates of the oxidation and reduction reactions are equal, and there's no net reaction happening, hence no observable current. However, when we depart from equilibrium (by applying an overpotential), the rates of the oxidation and reduction reactions become unequal, causing a net reaction to occur and a current to flow.

**3. Intuition:**

Think of electrochemical equilibrium as a seesaw in perfect balance. On one side, you have the oxidation reaction, and on the other side, you have the reduction reaction. When the seesaw is in balance (i.e., at equilibrium), the rates of the oxidation and reduction reactions are exactly the same, and there is no net movement. This balance is maintained by a specific potential difference between the two sides, which we call the equilibrium potential.

**4. Example:**

Let's consider a simple galvanic cell consisting of a zinc electrode in a ZnSO4 solution and a copper electrode in a CuSO4 solution. At equilibrium, the rate of zinc getting oxidized (Zn → Zn^2+ + 2e^-) is exactly equal to the rate of copper ions getting reduced (Cu^2+ + 2e^- → Cu). 

At this point, the potential difference between the two electrodes is the cell potential, which can be calculated using the Nernst equation. If the concentrations of Zn^2+ and Cu^2+ are both 1M (standard conditions), the cell potential will be equal to the difference in the standard electrode potentials of copper and zinc.
