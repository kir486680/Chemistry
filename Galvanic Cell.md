**1. Definition:**

A galvanic cell, also known as a [[Voltaic Cell]], is a device in which a chemical reaction between two substances produces an electric current. It is composed of two half-cells. Each half-cell consists of an [[Electrode]] (a strip of metal, M) and an [[Electrolyte]] (a solution of the metal's ions, M^n+). The two half-cells are connected by a [[Salt Bridge]] or a porous disc, allowing ions to flow without mixing the solutions. The half-cells are also connected by a wire, allowing electrons to flow.

The cell potential, E, is given by the [[Nernst Equation]]:

E = E° - (RT/nF)ln(Q)

**2. Context:**

Galvanic cells are the basis for batteries – devices that store chemical energy and convert it into electrical energy. They are an essential concept in electrochemistry and have numerous practical applications, from powering portable electronics to electric vehicles. They are also important for understanding related concepts like electrolytic cells (which operate in reverse, using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction).

**3. Intuition:**

Imagine two half-cells as two teams playing tug-of-war. One team (the reducing agent at the [[Anode]]) is weaker and loses electrons (the rope). The other team (the oxidizing agent at the [[Cathode]]) is stronger and pulls the electrons towards itself. This movement of electrons constitutes an electric current. The 'umpire' in this game is the salt bridge – it maintains the neutrality of the solutions by allowing counter ions to flow between the half-cells.

**4. Example:**

A classic example of a galvanic cell is the [[Daniell Cell]], which involves a zinc electrode in a zinc sulfate solution (the anode half-cell) and a copper electrode in a copper sulfate solution (the cathode half-cell).

At the anode, zinc is oxidized: Zn(s) → Zn^2+(aq) + 2e^-
At the cathode, copper is reduced: Cu^2+(aq) + 2e^- → Cu(s)

The electrons flow from the zinc to the copper through the wire, producing an electric current. The salt bridge allows sulfate ions to flow from the copper sulfate solution to the zinc sulfate solution, balancing the positive charge from the zinc ions that are produced at the anode.
