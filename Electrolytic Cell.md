**1. Definition:**

An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses electrical energy to drive a [[Non-Spontaneous Chemical Reaction]]. Like a [[Galvanic Cell]], an electrolytic cell consists of two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) and an [[Electrolyte]]. However, in an electrolytic cell, an external source of voltage (like a battery or a power supply) is used to force the reaction to proceed. 

In terms of equations, the cell potential (E) of an electrolytic cell is negative, according to the [[Nernst Equation]]:

E = E° - (RT/nF)ln(Q)

This negative value indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.

**2. Context:**

Electrolytic cells are essential in electrochemistry and have many practical applications, such as [[Electroplating]], electrosynthesis, and the electrolysis of water or salt. They are the opposite of [[Galvanic Cell]], which convert chemical energy into electrical energy spontaneously. Understanding electrolytic cells is important for grasping many electrochemical processes and technologies.

**3. Intuition:**

An intuitive way to understand electrolytic cells is to imagine you're on a bike going uphill. Normally, you would go downhill (a spontaneous process, analogous to a galvanic cell). But with enough effort (input of energy), you can ride uphill (a non-spontaneous process, analogous to an electrolytic cell). The bike is the reaction, and you (or the battery) are the source of external energy driving the reaction against its natural direction.

**4. Example:**

A common example of an electrolytic cell is the electrolysis of water. In this process, an electric current is passed through water (H2O), causing it to decompose into hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2). 

At the anode (positive electrode), water is oxidized: 2H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4H^(+) + 4e^(-)
At the cathode (negative electrode), water is reduced: 2H2O(l) + 2e^(-) → H2(g) + 2OH^(-)

The overall reaction is the decomposition of water: 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)

The battery or power supply provides the energy needed for this non-spontaneous reaction to occur. Without it, the reaction would not proceed under [[Standard Conditions]].
