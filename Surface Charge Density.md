(σ): Surface charge density, denoted by the symbol σ (sigma), represents the amount of electric charge per unit area on a surface. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

   σ = Q / A

   where σ is the surface charge density, Q is the total charge, and A is the surface area.

   Implication: Surface charge density helps describe the charge distribution on a two-dimensional surface. It provides information about the charge concentration on the surface and affects the behavior of the electric field near that surface.

   Intuition: Consider a charged conductor with a total charge Q distributed over its surface area A. The surface charge density σ would indicate how much charge is present per unit area. Higher surface charge density implies a higher concentration of charge on a specific surface.

   Example: A uniformly charged conducting plate with a total charge Q. The surface charge density would be σ = Q / A, where A is the area of the plate.
