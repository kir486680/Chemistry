the resistance in an [[Electrochemical Cell]] can be modeled by a combination of ohmic resistance, kinetic resistance, and mass transport resistance. These resistances contribute to the overall impedance of the cell. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **[[Ohmic Resistance]]**: 
    
2. **[[Kinetic (or Charge Transfer) Resistance]]**: 
    
3. **[[Mass Transport Resistance (or Concentration Polarization)]]**:
