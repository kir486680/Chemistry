1. Diffusion: Diffusion refers to the spontaneous movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is driven by the random thermal motion of particles. In other words, particles tend to move down their concentration gradient in order to achieve a uniform distribution. Diffusion is a passive process and does not require an external force. It plays a fundamental role in processes such as the mixing of gases, the spreading of solutes in a solvent, and the transport of substances across biological membranes.
    
2. Convection: Convection involves the movement of particles through a medium due to the bulk flow of the medium itself. This transport mechanism occurs when there is a difference in temperature or density within the medium. Convection can be classified into two types: natural convection and forced convection. Natural convection occurs when the movement of the medium is solely induced by temperature or density differences, while forced convection involves the use of external means, such as pumps or fans, to move the medium. Convection is an essential process in various systems, including heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and atmospheric circulation.
    
3. Migration: Migration, also known as electromigration, is a transport phenomenon involving charged particles, such as ions or electrons, under the influence of an electric field. When an electric field is applied to a medium containing charged particles, they experience a force and move in response to this force. Migration is particularly relevant in electrochemical systems, such as batteries and electrolytic cells. It is used for the controlled movement of ions during processes like electrophoresis, where particles can be separated based on their charge and size.
