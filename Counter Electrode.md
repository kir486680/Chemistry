1.  **Material**: The counter electrode material should be inert to the electrolyte solution and should not participate in the electrodeposition process. Platinum is often used due to its high conductivity and chemical stability. For instance, in a study titled "Black electrochromic ink with a straightforward method using copper oxide nanoparticle suspension" published in Scientific Reports, a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode in a three-electrode cell setup for the electrodeposition of copper oxide films [1](https://chat.openai.com/c/2aec1c2c-3d1b-4c1a-b35f-6224bebd69ce#user-content-fn-10.1038/s41598-023-34839-9%5E).
    
2.  **Reactivity**: The counter electrode generally does not undergo any chemical changes during the electrodeposition process. Its primary role is to complete the electrical circuit by accepting or donating electrons. However, under certain conditions, such as when the counter electrode material is not chemically inert to the electrolyte solution, it may participate in side reactions.
    
3.  **Industry Use**: In industrial applications, the choice of counter electrode material often depends on the specific requirements of the electrodeposition process, such as the type of metal being deposited, the composition of the electrolyte solution, and the desired properties of the deposited layer. Platinum is commonly used due to its excellent conductivity and chemical stability. However, other materials like graphite or stainless steel may also be used in some cases.
    
4.  **Size and Shape**: The size and shape of the counter electrode can influence the uniformity of the deposited layer. It should be large enough to ensure a uniform current distribution across the working electrode. The shape of the counter electrode should also be designed to promote a uniform electric field in the electrolyte solution.
    
5.  **Placement**: The placement of the counter electrode in relation to the working electrode can also affect the electrodeposition process. It should be positioned to ensure a uniform electric field and to minimize any potential disturbances in the electrolyte solution.
