**Definition:**

The electrode potential, also known as the redox potential, is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire electrons and thereby be reduced. Each species has its own intrinsic electrode potential; the more positive the potential, the greater the species' affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced.

Standard electrode potentials (E°) are measured under standard conditions: 25°C, 1 atm pressure, and 1M concentrations for all species. They are usually quoted relative to the [[Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)]], which is arbitrarily given a potential of 0.00 volts.

**Context:**

Electrode potentials play a crucial role in electrochemistry. They allow us to predict the direction of redox reactions, determine the [[Electromotive Force(EMF)]] of electrochemical cells, and understand the principles of [[Electroplating]] and corrosion. They are central to the [[Nernst Equation]], which describes the effect of concentration on cell potential.

**Intuition:**

Think of electrode potentials as a measure of a substance's eagerness to accept electrons. The more positive the electrode potential, the greater the substance's desire for electrons. It's like a ranking system: the species with the most positive electrode potential gets to be reduced in a reaction, while the species with the less positive (or more negative) potential gets oxidized.

**Example:**

Consider an electrochemical cell with a zinc electrode in a Zn^2+ solution (E° = -0.76V vs SHE) as one half-cell, and a copper electrode in a Cu^2+ solution (E° = 0.34V vs SHE) as the other half-cell.

The standard cell potential (E°_cell) can be calculated by subtracting the standard electrode potential of the anode (where oxidation occurs) from the standard electrode potential of the cathode (where reduction occurs). 

So, E°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode = 0.34V - (-0.76V) = 1.10V.

The positive cell potential indicates that the reaction will occur spontaneously in the direction written. Zinc will dissolve into the solution as Zn^2+, releasing electrons that move through the external circuit to the copper electrode, where they reduce Cu^2+ ions to copper metal. This is the fundamental process driving the operation of a battery.

Understanding electrode potentials provides a solid basis for understanding and predicting the outcomes of electrochemical reactions, including those involved in electrodeposition.
