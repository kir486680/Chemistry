Assume that the chemical activity of an electron in a metal is constant because there are so many electrons in the metal. 

Potential of electron in solution is basically how much potential did I add by converting an oxidized part of the couple into the reduced part of the couple 

To generate enough voltage in a cell, this cell needs to have enough current generating capacity. This means that there should be a good amount of reducing/oxidizing agents. Small amounts of O/R means that you will have low current which means that you will be having a large resistance.

If your cell resistance is higher than the measuring device resistance, you will not be able to measure the true voltage with your measuring device.
